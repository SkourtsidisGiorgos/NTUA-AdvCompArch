# NTUA-AdvCompArch
2019-2020 NTUA class "Advanced Computer Architecture"

Students had to run benchmarks in simulations of CPU’s, using INTEL’s PIN
tool. The purpose was to compare the efficacy and accuracy of:
1) Various sizes and configurations of L1,L2 Cache and Main memory.
2) Branch Predictors
3) Superscalar, Out-of-order CPUs
4) Multithreading and lock protocols


Students also had to implement some branch predictors and mutual exclusion
protocols in C++,use bash scripts to run the benchmarks and plot the results
using Python.
